This Directory contains code to provide APIs for Lower Level REMOTE Control over the Drone's onboard System.
Basically The code here is an alternative to the Onboard ControlAbstraction, provided simply
to offload the board from control related calculations and computation.
This Directory also provides APIs for Manual Physical Remote Control as well as abstraction to enable it to run over 
the Microsoft AirSim Simulatior.

DirectControl/      -->         Code and APIs for handling over commands to the remote drone computers
PhysicalRemote/     -->         A Manual Physical Remote Control, contains Code and APIs to directly or indirectly 
                                (over serial using arduino attached to its reciever) fetch control commands from 
                                a physical manual remote controller and issue commands over to the drone via the 
                                DirectControl APIs or to the AirSim System.

AbstractControls    -->         Abstract classes to provide APIs for control and communicating to the drone
AirSimControls      -->         Implementation of the Controller class for AirSim Controls
DirectControls      -->         Implemntations of the Controller class for Actual Real Drone Controls
