This Directory contains code for the physical controlling of the drone via communicating to the flight controller.

The code provides APIs for abstract access to the flight controller, as well as code to setup a server which listens for 
external commands, which it can then redirect to the flight controller, basically acting as a middle layer.
Such external command sources can be commands from the Higher level Control Abstraction which themselves operate under the
commands from the Purpose layer, or a direct manual remote, which can command over wifi, or a remote Control Stack.

SPIdrivers.can          -->         APIs to communicate over the SPI interface
BasicControls.cpp       -->         APIs to command the flight controller to take actions 
ControlServer.cpp       -->         Setup a control server and listen over a particular socket for commands

OnBoard Control Systems can directly access the flight controller via BasicControls API while Remote Control Systems and Manual Systems 
may access it over the ControlServer API.
