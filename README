Well, This is, in a way, an Operating System for Multicopters and UAVs.
This consists of the software stack, I have been developing for a hobby project 
to achieve a level 5 Autonomous UAV System.

The Base System consists of code and abstractions for systems that would run
on a local offboard machine. It also contains code for manual control and intervention 
using a physical remote to control the craft.

The Onboard System contains code and abstractions for systems that would operate 
on a remote computer attached to the drone's flight controller directly, inturn 
dictating the flight controller to behave as the base system and onboard systems 
decides. This also consists of sensor servers to relay the data back to the base 
station.

There is also an 'Onboard' implementation for the AirSim Simulator, to test the 
system and software stack in a virtual enviornment, safely and accurately.
Microsoft AirSim is an Unreal Engine 4 based Simulation enviornment for research 
and testing purposes for UAVs and cars.

After basic ground work is done and foundations are layed out, We would move on 
to experiment with Machine Learning Models (Both, Supervised and Reinforcement Learning based)
to help achieve the level of automation that we desire.

This project is in a nut shell, an attempt to make a complete software stack for 
a fully autonomous UAV System.
