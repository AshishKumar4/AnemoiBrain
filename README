OnBoard Systems 
- Control Abstractions 
    -- MotorBrain.py : Middle Layer between Raw Control and Kernel, Contains Emergency Reflexes, All control commands pass throughs this

        --- RawControl.py :  Abstraction Layer to actually forward control signals to Flight Controller
    

- Sensor Abstractions 
    -- SpatialMaps.py : Contains Code to generate and process spatial maps of surroundings based on visual data

        --- VirtualSensors.py : Abstraction API to provide Sensory Data in a reliable way to Upper Layers + Scalablity to 
                                provide to all 

- Purpose Abstractions : Highest Level of abstraction
    -- VideoClassification : Contains programs to run Video Classification algorithms for e.g, Surviellance

- Navigation.py : Contains Code for Auto Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance

- Kernel.py : Contains Actual Kernel Initialization And Management Code. The Heart of this OS.
